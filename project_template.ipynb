    "For this project, analisis of the relationship between a US-State's GDP per capita and its air traffic movements are being conducted. GDP measures the monetary value of final goods and services produced within a state's borders during a specific period, such as a quarter or a year. We aim to determine whether states with higher GDPs exhibit greater air traffic mobility compared to those with lower GDPs, or if there is no discernible correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data of the GPD several databases were used. Firstly ..... was used to obtain the GDP per state over the years from 2005 up until 2022. This data is combined with the population data found at ..... Both these datasets are used to obtain the value of GDP per capita. This value is needed because in this way you can compare the states with eachother. Also, within these datasets the chained 2012 dollars are given. In this way we can account for the inflation and other infleunces and therefore can easily compare 2008 to 2020 for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of flight movemets are all air traffic movements within a state. This means that both departing and arriving aircraft are counted. Within the data a distiction of domestic and international flights can be made. This will also be used to answer certain sub-questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before focussing on the US, GDP data from all over the world was considered. However when analising data from the Open-Sky network it was concluded that using this database was quite complicated and that the amount of data was to much to handle. After doing some online research detailed data from the US was found and the main reseach objective was reshaped to the current version.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fight data that was used was found on the website of the Department of Transportation. As said above the data shows the which carrier performed how many flights from one destination to another in each quarter. During this project only air traffic movements in a state will be considered and not the specific locations of the cities. Important about this data is that either departure, arrival, or both must be within the borders of the US. Futhermore, private aircraft are not included in this dataset and the data ranges from 2005 up until 2022."
