    "For this project, we will analyze the relationship between a country's GDP per capita and its air traffic mobility. GDP measures the monetary value of final goods and services produced within a country's borders during a specific period, such as a quarter or a year. We aim to determine whether countries with higher GDPs exhibit greater air traffic mobility compared to those with lower GDPs, or if there is no discernible correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "For the flight data we found two different data sets with each its own pros and cons. \\\n",
    "The different data sets form OpenSky provide information about all the aircraft movements. We can use all air traffic movements to and from all the airports in a country. The data will be filtered by only picking comercial aircraft and cargo aircraft, private aircraft will not be considered. Furthermore the origin country of the departed flights will be used, which gives us an overview of amount of takeoffs per country. This should be a good indicator for the relative amount of air traffic movements per country when compared to the GDP. However the amount of data that needs to be processed for this is huge and could potentially lead to problems.\\\n",
    "The second data set we found is from The World Bank: 'Air transport, registered carrier departures worldwide'. This data discribes the amount of registerd aircraft takeoffs on scheduled services (i.e. plannend commercial flights both passenger and cargo) by country the aircraft is registered in. The data set gives us takeoffs per country per year which should make processing the data not too complicated and thus make it possible to go for an overview of multiple years. However, this data might not completely represent the goals of our research objective since it does not discripe the amount of aircraft movements per country. An aircraft can be registered in a country where it does not depart from or arrive in.\n",
